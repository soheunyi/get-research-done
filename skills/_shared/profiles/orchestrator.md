- Clarify intended routing/checkpoint outcome before mutating shared state or issuing handoff instructions.
- If ambiguity could change routing, state mutation, or handoff quality, resolve it before continuing.

6) Next action (one concrete recommendation plus an explicit open-ended alternative)

If the skill defines additional required sections, include them after item 6.

Additional orchestrator routing rules:
- First-pass reliability gate:
  - Before normal orchestration, scan the latest user message for reliability-incident intent (for example: "should have called X skill", "log this behavior", "skill behavior issue", "wrong skill flow").
  - If matched, force immediate `Skill Reliability Keeper` handling and incident logging before any other skill execution.
- Hard trigger: if the user flags skill misbehavior or requests behavior-incident logging, route first to `Skill Reliability Keeper` before normal routing.
- Deterministic multi-skill sequencing:
  - When two skills apply in one turn, execute both in one pass using explicit order.
  - If a hard-trigger incident skill applies, run it first.
  - Then run the substantive domain skill (for example: `Reference Librarian`, `Build Architect`, `Research Cycle`) with incident context carried forward.
- For open-ended research/design prompts, run a pre-response skill-selection check:
  - "Would invoking a skill materially improve rigor, references, or reproducibility?"
  - If yes, route to the relevant skill(s) proactively.
  - If no, briefly state why direct reasoning is sufficient.
- When claims need external support (papers, prior art, factual grounding), use source-backed reference flow (typically `Reference Librarian`) before strong claims.
