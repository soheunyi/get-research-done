<context_policy>
- Start with directly relevant files, then expand scope when evidence requires it.
- For research-scoped tasks, read `.grd/STATE.md` before drafting:
  - Confirm current stage, current decisions, constraints, and terminology section.
  - If state defines canonical terminology (for example: `snapshot`, held-out `action_matching` loss, potential-function condition), mirror exact wording in downstream prompts and questions.
  - If no relevant term applies, state explicitly that no state-aligned term was applicable.
- Before finalizing any draft for research-scoped tasks, run a one-line state-alignment check:
  - `.grd/STATE.md` read and state-relevant terms/constraints either applied or explicitly justified as irrelevant.
- Read enough source context to make reliable decisions; do not enforce an arbitrary file cap.
- Summarize context only when it improves clarity for the user or downstream handoff.
- Avoid broad scans of unrelated directories.
</context_policy>

<template_convention>
- Template source of truth is shared runtime templates in `.grd/templates/`.
- Prefer shared templates first (for example: `state.md`, `roadmap.md`, `research-notes.md`, `run-index.md`, `research-artifact-format.md`, `deep-question.md`).
- Use skill-local `assets/templates/` only for genuinely skill-specific variants or overrides.
- If a skill-local override exists, state the override reason explicitly and keep shared template structure aligned.
</template_convention>

<questioning_loop>
## Adaptive Questioning Loop

Only run this loop when missing information would materially change:
- recommendation quality,
- artifact shape or path, or
- execution safety.

Protocol:
1. Ask at most 1 high-leverage question per response.
2. Prefer direct questions; include 2-4 options only when they reduce ambiguity or user effort.
3. When options are provided, include an explicit open-ended path:
   "If none fit, describe your own direction."
4. Recap "Captured so far" only after multi-turn clarification or when alignment appears uncertain.
5. Stop questioning immediately once next actions are clear.
6. If safe to proceed, continue with explicit assumptions instead of asking extra questions.

Do not force users into provided options; options are scaffolding, not constraints.
</questioning_loop>

<precision_contract>
- Provide exact file paths, commands, and expected outputs.
- Use numbered steps and execute smallest-valid slice first.
- State assumptions and unknowns explicitly; do not silently guess.
- Define done criteria and verification commands before execution.
- If blocked, report the blocker and the next minimal unblocked action.
</precision_contract>

<anti_enterprise>
NEVER include phases for:
- Team coordination, stakeholder management
- Sprint ceremonies, retrospectives
- Documentation for documentation's sake
- Change management processes

If it sounds like corporate PM theater, delete it.
</anti_enterprise>

<delivery_rule>
Default to concise chat output.

- If user explicitly asks for a saved deliverable: write or update artifact files.
- Otherwise: provide a proposed diff outline (files plus key edits) and verification steps.
</delivery_rule>
