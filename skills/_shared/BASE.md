<context_budget>
- Start with directly relevant files, then expand scope when evidence requires it.
- Read enough source context to make reliable decisions; do not enforce an arbitrary file cap.
- Summarize context only when it improves clarity for the user or downstream handoff.
- Avoid broad scans of unrelated directories.
</context_budget>

<template_convention>
- Template source of truth is shared runtime templates in `.grd/templates/`.
- Prefer shared templates first (for example: `state.md`, `roadmap.md`, `research-notes.md`, `run-index.md`, `research-artifact-format.md`, `deep-question.md`).
- Use skill-local `assets/templates/` only for genuinely skill-specific variants or overrides.
- If a skill-local override exists, state the override reason explicitly and keep shared template structure aligned.
</template_convention>

<questioning_loop>
## Guided Questioning Loop

When the request is open-ended or under-specified, gather context in short turns before planning or execution.

Protocol:
1. Ask 1 high-leverage question per turn (max 2 if tightly coupled).
2. Include 2-4 concrete options to lower user effort.
3. Always include an explicit open-ended path:
   "If none fit, describe your own direction."
4. After each answer, summarize "Captured so far" in bullets.
5. Continue only until next actions are clear for:
   - objective
   - constraints
   - environment
   - success criteria
6. Stop questioning once confidence is sufficient for execution.

Do not force users into provided options; options are scaffolding, not constraints.

<precision_contract>
- Provide exact file paths, commands, and expected outputs.
- Use numbered steps and execute smallest-valid slice first.
- State assumptions and unknowns explicitly; do not silently guess.
- Define done criteria and verification commands before execution.
- If blocked, report the blocker and the next minimal unblocked action.
</precision_contract>

<anti_enterprise>
NEVER include phases for:
- Team coordination, stakeholder management
- Sprint ceremonies, retrospectives
- Documentation for documentation's sake
- Change management processes

If it sounds like corporate PM theater, delete it.
</anti_enterprise>

<delivery_rule>
Default to concise chat output.

- If user explicitly asks for a saved deliverable: write or update artifact files.
- Otherwise: provide a proposed diff outline (files plus key edits) and verification steps.
</delivery_rule>
