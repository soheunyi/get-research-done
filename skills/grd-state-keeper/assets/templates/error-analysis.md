## Data Integrity and Leakage Checks
- Split integrity check:
- Duplicate leakage check (exact and near-duplicate):
- Feature leakage check:
- Label timestamp leakage check:

## Sanity Checks
- Label shuffle control (if applicable):
- Degenerate baseline check:
- Metric bounds/invariance checks:

## Slice Analysis
- Subgroup slices:
- Difficulty bins:
- Class-wise slices:
- Length/size-wise slices:

## Failure Case Sampling
- Sampling policy:
- Representative failures:
- Root-cause hypotheses:
- Remediation candidates:

## Decision
- Most likely failure mode:
- Recommended next action:
