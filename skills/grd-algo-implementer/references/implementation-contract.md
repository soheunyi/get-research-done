# Implementation Contract

Use this file for algorithm implementation details.

## Core Rules
- correctness before optimization
- deterministic defaults for seeds and ordering
- smallest testable slice first
- explicit assumptions and failure modes

## Required Outputs
- module/function mapping
- data contract mapping
- complexity + bottleneck summary
- focused tests for correctness + boundary cases

## Artifact
Write `.grd/research/ALGO_IMPLEMENTATION.md` when requested.
