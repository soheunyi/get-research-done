# Architecture Principles

- reduce future decision cost
- favor incremental migration over big-bang rewrites
- make ownership and dependency direction explicit
- map every structure proposal to executable slices

Required architecture outputs:
- repository layout
- module boundaries
- interface/class responsibilities
- state/data flow contracts
