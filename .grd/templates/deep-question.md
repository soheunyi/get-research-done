# Deep Reasoning Question Template

Use this template when drafting a question for a deep-thinking model.

## Format and Mode Declaration
- Mode: `deep_reasoning` | `lit_review`
- Desired format profile: `strict_structured` | `compact_brief` | `theorem_proof` | `research_brief` | custom
- If custom, format instruction:

## Context Summary
- Known facts:
- Current approach:
- Unknowns that matter:
- Assumptions:

## Main Question
Write one precise question sentence here.

Optional sub-questions:
1. ...
2. ...

## Definitions / Math Setup
- Terms:
- Symbols:
- Domain and conditions:
- Objective or target claim:
- What "prove/derive/estimate/bound" means here:
- Assumptions and approximations:

## Literature Review Scope and Search Strategy (If Applicable)
- Topic boundary:
- Inclusion criteria:
- Exclusion criteria:
- Time window:
- Preferred source types:
- Seed keywords / queries:
- Required synthesis style (taxonomy/comparison/gaps):
- Citation expectations:

## Constraints
- In scope:
- Out of scope:
- Allowed methods:
- Disallowed methods:
- Time/compute limits:
- Rigor level expected:

## Non-Negotiable Quality Constraints
- Keep mathematical notation consistent and define symbols once.
- Require explicit reasoning path (stepwise rationale or equivalent transparent logic).
- Make final output checkable against stated objectives and constraints.

## Expected Answer Format
1. Short answer in 2-4 sentences.
2. Step-by-step reasoning with explicit assumptions.
3. Final result with confidence and caveats.

## Success Criteria
- The response answers the exact main question.
- Every symbol/term in the math setup is used consistently.
- Key assumptions and limitations are explicit.
- The final conclusion is checkable against provided constraints.

## Pitfalls To Avoid
- Ambiguous terms without operational definition.
- Unstated assumptions.
- Notation drift (same symbol used for different things).
- Jumps in derivation without justification.

## User Additional Question (Optional)
[User can add one extra question here.]

## Outcome Notes (After Response)
- Summary of response quality:
- What was useful:
- What was missing:
- Follow-up question (if needed):
